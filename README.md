# Morpho Blue Oracles

Morpho Blue Oracles are contracts that can be used as oracles for markets on [Morpho Blue](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-blue).
The oracles implement the `IOracle` interface defined in [`IOracle.sol`](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-blue/blob/main/src/interfaces/IOracle.sol#L9): they return the price of 1 asset of collateral token quoted in 1 asset of loan token.

## MorphoChainlinkOracleV2

The `MorphoChainlinkOracleV2` is an oracle that uses Chainlink-interface-compliant feeds to provide price data.

This oracle handles the following cases among others (let's say that our pair is A/B):

- A/B is a feed (typically, stETH/ETH).
- B/A is a feed (typically, ETH/USDC).
- A/C and B/C are feeds (typically, stETH/ETH and USDC/ETH).
- A/C, C/D and B/D are feeds (typically, WBTC/BTC, BTC/USD, USDC/USD).
- A/D, and B/C, C/D are feeds (typically, USDC/USD, WBTC/BTC, BTC/USD).
- A/C, C/D and B/E, E/D are feeds.
- A/C and C/B are feeds (typically, WBTC/BTC and BTC/ETH).
- A'/C and B/C are feeds, and there is an exchange rate between A and A'. (typically A=sDAI and A'=DAI).

### MorphoChainlinkOracleV2Factory

The `MorphoChainlinkOracleV2Factory` is a factory that deploys `MorphoChainlinkOracleV2` instances.

The factory facilitates the creation and indexing of `MorphoChainlinkOracleV2` oracles. This factory contract streamlines the process of deploying new oracles, catering to various market pairs without the need to deploy individual contracts manually for each pair.

#### Deploy an Oracle

To deploy a `MorphoChainlinkOracleV2` on the Ethereum mainnet, use the `MorphoChainlinkOracleV2Factory` to create a new oracle. Call the `createMorphoChainlinkOracleV2` function with the following parameters:

- `baseVault`: The ERC4626 token vault for the base asset.
- `baseVaultConversionSample`: A sample amount for converting base vault units.
- `baseFeed1`, `baseFeed2`: Chainlink-interface-compliant data feeds for the base asset.
- `baseTokenDecimals`: Decimal precision of the base asset.
- `quoteVault`: The ERC4626 token vault for the quote asset.
- `quoteVaultConversionSample`: A sample amount for converting quote vault units.
- `quoteFeed1`, `quoteFeed2`: Chainlink-interface-compliant data feeds for the quote asset.
- `quoteTokenDecimals`: Decimal precision of the quote asset.
- `salt`: A unique identifier to create deterministic addresses for deployed oracles.

**Warning:** If there is an ERC4626-compliant vault for `baseVault` or `quoteVault`, the `baseTokenDecimals` or `quoteTokenDecimals` are still the decimals of the asset in the vault, and not the decimals of the Vault asset.
E.g: for a MetaMorpho WETH vault, as `baseVault`, the `baseTokenDecimals` is 18 as WETH has 18 decimals.

#### Addresses

The Ethereum Mainnet address of this factory is [0x3A7bB36Ee3f3eE32A60e9f2b33c1e5f2E83ad766](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a7bb36ee3f3ee32a60e9f2b33c1e5f2e83ad766#code).
